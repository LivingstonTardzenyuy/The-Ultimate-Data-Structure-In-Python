 Types of Linked Lists

 we have four types of linked Lists

 1. Single Linked Lists
 2. Cirucular Single linked Lists
 3. Double linked Lists
 4. Cirucular Double linke Lists.



 1. Single linked Lists
    each node stores the value and the reference to the next node 

2. Cirucular Single linked Lists
    it is a Single linked Lists where the last node stores the address of the first node  hence we have no null.
    here we have an object of reaching the last node and going back to the first node

    it is used in chess game

    e.g when playing a die game between more than two players.
        if we have 3 players then player1 plays, player2 plays, player3 plays then player1 plays again 


3. Double linked Lists
    this is a linked list that each node point to the address of each node and the previous node. 
    hence each node has 2 references.

    e.g a music player were we can play a music where we can next and prev.

4. Cirucular Double linke list.
    it is a Cirucular linked list were the address of the last node points to the address of the first node.
    
    e.g whe  n we press ctrl+tab and we navigate accross each program continously
