linked list
def: a link list is a data structure made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference to the next node i the link

for example: a train is a type of link list.
            A train is composed of d/f cars and each car is link to the next car and the total forms a link list

            The train has head and tail as a link list.

            we can remove each car and the train still work hence each compartment in the train is independent as same as link list.

            soo a train satisfy all properties of link list hence a train is a link list.

            
            the first component of link list is the head

            the last component is the Tail

            A node contains Value of node, reference of next node.

            we store the Tail b/c we can insert an element at the end of a link list.




            D/F between Arrays and LinkList

                Arrays do almost everything that link list do such as add, delete, update etc 

                1.  Elements of linked list are independent objects as opposed to arrays b/c when we delete an element in a array the index is not deleleted
                2.  Link is has variabel size as opposed to arrays since we must define the size of the array.
                3.  Insertion and removals in linked list are very efficient
                4.  Link list are not random arrays as opposed to  Arrays are Random access
