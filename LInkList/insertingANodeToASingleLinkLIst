# insertion to linked list in memory
# we can insert an element in a link list in 3 d/f ways

# 1. At the beginning of the linked list.
# 2. After a node i.e middle of a link list
# 3. At the end of the Link list


# 1. Inserting at the begining of linked list

#     allocate a random memory for the head in a link list
#     we break the connection and the head points to the newly created node then the newly created node points to the node of the node that was BrokenPipeError
#     the time complexity is O(1)


# 2. MIddle of link list 
#     we traverse from head to the node were we want to add
#     we allocate a random location for the new node 
#     now break the link and put it to the newly newly node
    

# 3. Add at the end of the link list
#     we traverse from head to the last element
#     we allocate a ramdon meomery locatio fo rthe new node
#     then we add the element
#     the time complexity is O(n)


#     N.B the best way is to add at the begining of the link list
